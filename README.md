⛏   We specialize in creating a hacked minecraft client on versions 1.8-1.19.3, using the built-in ViaVersion.

🗽   Our main goal is to provide you with a free and open client that allows you to explore modules and make your own changes. We also strive to develop new and interesting modules that will help you in the game.
